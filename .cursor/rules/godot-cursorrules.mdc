# Godot 4.4 Game Development .cursorrules

## Core Development Guidelines

- Always use @export annotations instead of direct node references
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Use signals for loose coupling between nodes
- Follow Godot's node naming conventions (PascalCase for nodes, snake_case for methods)

## Code Style

- Document complex functions with docstrings
- Keep methods focused and under 24 lines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Group related properties and methods together
- Use TABS instead of spaces

## Naming Conventions

- Files: Use snake_case for all filenames (e.g., player_character.gd, main_menu.tscn)
- Classes: Use PascalCase for custom class names with class_name (e.g., PlayerCharacter)
- Variables: Use snake_case for all variables including member variables (e.g., health_points)
- Constants: Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., MAX_HEALTH)
- Functions: Use snake_case for all functions including lifecycle functions (e.g., move_player())
- Functions: Don't use leading underscore '_' in private functions, variables in GDScript
- Enums: Use PascalCase for enum type names and ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for enum values
- Nodes: Use PascalCase for node names in the scene tree (e.g., PlayerCharacter, MainCamera)
- Signals: Use snake_case in past tense to name events (e.g., health_depleted, enemy_defeated)

## Scene Organization

- Use scene inheritance for reusable components
- Implement proper scene cleanup on queue_free()

## Signal Best Practices

- Use clear, contextual signal names that describe their purpose (e.g., player_health_changed)
- Utilize typed signals to improve safety and IDE assistance (e.g., signal item_collected(item_name: String))
- Connect signals in code for dynamic nodes, and in the editor for static relationships
- Avoid overusing signals - reserve them for important events, not frequent updates
- Pass only necessary data through signal arguments, avoiding entire node references when possible
- Use an autoload "EventBus" singleton for global signals that need to reach distant nodes (e.g., gate_events.gd)
- Minimize signal bubbling through multiple parent nodes
- Always disconnect signals when nodes are freed to prevent memory leaks
- Document signals with comments explaining their purpose and parameters

## Resource Management

- Implement proper resource cleanup in \_exit_tree()

## Performance Best Practices

- Use node groups judiciously for managing collections, and prefer direct node references for frequent, specific access to individual nodes.
- Implement object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Use physics layers to optimize collision detection
- Prefer packed arrays (PackedVector2Array, etc.) over regular arrays

## Error Handling

- Log errors appropriately in production builds
- Handle network errors gracefully in multiplayer games
